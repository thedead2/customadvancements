# Custom Advancements
A minecraft mod that gives players creative freedom about advancements

Custom Advancements is a minecraft mod that enables players to add their own custom advancements to the game, remove certain advancements, disable the load of advancements completely or just disable the load of minecrafts recipe advancements. 
It functions a little like a datapack but for all created worlds and is especially useful for modpack creators who want to base their modpack on an advancement system.
